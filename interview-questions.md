# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Rails follows an MVC pattern. What does that mean?

  Your answer:
    Model, View, Controller. MVC is the structure adopted by Ruby on Rails. It represents the three axes of a full stack application. The model represents the shape of data held in the database. The view
    is the way data is presented to the user when called upon. The controller dictates which data to reveal when a server is queried.

2. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer:
    A relational database is structured such that entries are able to be associated with each other in many ways. Objects can be grouped together in tables. Those tables can belong to other tables, belong to
    tables that belong to tables, be associated with tables through other tables, etc. This allows for intricate mapping of structure in a database.

3. What is object-relational mapping?

  Your answer:
    ORM refers to communication between a server that speaks one language and another resource that speaks an incompatible language. ORM allows these two entities to communicate and interact using translation.
    It also allows for database structures that are otherwise difficult to interpret by human eyes to be presented in more legible ways. ActiveRecord is a wonderful example of ORM implemented in real life.

4. What is a gem?

  Your answer:
    In Ruby, a gem is what would be referred to as a module or plugin in Javascript. Typically open-source. They add tools or behavior to a project. Some gems can conflict, so a developer should exercise caution
    when installing multiple gems that may not work together. If you can think of something you want your project to do, there's probably a gem for it. Rails itself is essentially a collection of gems.

5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer:
    A primary key is the unique identifier for an entry in a database. In Rails these keys are simply an incrementing integer. However, they can be anything as long as they are unique and do not repeat anywhere
    throughout the database. Primary keys are important because they are the only thing that is always unique about an entry. They are what distinguishes between otherwise identical pieces of data.
